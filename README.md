This project aims to:
  “enable the users to search and find appropriate mentors based on parameters (e.g., expertise, location) with 90% of queries getting correct results in less than 10 seconds by the first quarter of 2024.”

 “ensure that mentor profiles show complete and accurate information (e.g., name, expertise, availability) 100% of the time in the first three months after launching.”

  “achieve at least 70% of active users searching for mentors in the first six months   of system rollout.”
	
“continue to accommodate for simultaneous searches of up to 300 mentors with no slowing down or errors within a year.

  “achieve a 100% guarantee against unauthorized access incidents if end-to-end encryption for user and mentor data is provided.”	
	
  “collect and analyze mentor search data to produce meaningful insight for the purpose of system improvement. The work will be due by the second quarter of 2024.”
