  -“achieve a 100% guarantee against unauthorized access incidents if end-to-end encryption for user and mentor data is provided.”	
	
  -“collect and analyze mentor search data to produce meaningful insight for the purpose of system improvement. The work will be due by the second quarter of 2024.”

## SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

This program aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 4, 8, and 9 by fostering education, economic growth, and innovation.

SDG 4: Quality Education
	The program supports SDG 4 through the mentorship of students and thereby providing the opportunity for better learning and development. The platform connects users with mentors who have teaching, educational resources, and guidance for personal and professional growth. This way, more information about the topic is given without taking the place of the formal educational process, thus enriching all the participants with new useful skills with the hope of future success. It makes people be capable of curing their lack of study, learning other abilities, developing new working skills and eventually, building a better future when they become earners for a living. This also leads to the culture of lifelong learning.
	
SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
	This system helps for SDG 8 by creating jobs for instance by way of professional mentoring. It advocates for enhancement of individuals’ skills which renders them more competitive in the labor market thus increasing overall economic productivity. As this program helps senior professionals to mentor those who are ready to move in their careers, it increases the probability of economic mobility for their users as well as provides access to eminent professionals and skilled mentors.

	
SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure
	The program aligns with SDG 9 by offering a creative platform that brings mentors and apprentices together, improving how knowledge and skills are shared. By using digital technology, it creates an accessible and scalable way for individuals to grow personally and professionally. This method helps close knowledge gaps, especially in industries where ongoing learning and skill development are essential. At the same time, it supports industry growth by strengthening the skills of the workforce, making it more adaptable and ready for the future.
